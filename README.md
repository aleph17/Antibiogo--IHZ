# Antibiogo--IHZ
This repo includes codes written for Antibiogo's inhibition zone prediction part. It is only a copy of the work in progress. The original code is kept inside the private repo of MSF (Medecins Sans Frontières) together with other parts of the project. Only legally permitted part has been published in this repo.

This software is part of the Antibiogo application, a project of Fondation Medecins Sans Frontières.

Antibiogo is a mobile application that reads and interprets disk diffusion based Antibiotic Susceptibility Tests (ASTs) by taking a picture of the bacterial culture with a smartphone.

Antibiogo is a free, off-line-working smartphone application conceived to help the non-expert lab staff in low resource settings with the interpretation of ASTs in their daily lab activity. It will perform the analysis of AST pictures and provide advice for appropriate patient treatment.
